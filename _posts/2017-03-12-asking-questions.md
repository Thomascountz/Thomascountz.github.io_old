Every young developer has to ask questions. Likewise, every senior developer must ask questions too. However, a major difference between the two is *how* questions get asked. It's often joked that a developerâ€™s biggest skill is their ability to Google. But what happens when Google doesn't know anything about your custom libraries, unconventional meta-programming, and proprietary APIs? You're left with your *what*, *how*, and *why*. 

# What is *What*, *How*, *Why*?
<br>
*What*, *how*, and *why*, is a tool to help you organize your knowledge, find gaps in your understanding, and formulate a question that will get you the missing piece of information that you need. 
<br>
<br>
When you're faced with a problem, you're often missing information is one or more of the following three categories:
* What
* How
* Why

Let's look at an example: adding <code>has_secure_password</code> to a <code>user</code> model in Rails. I know **what** is does, and I know **why** I should use it, but I'm not sure **how** to migrate a new <code>password</code> and <code>password_confirmation</code> column in my <code>user</code> table.
<br>
<br>
Or another one: I know **what** the syntax is to <code>@import</code> <code>"Bootstrap-sprockets";</code> and <code>"Bootstrap";</code> in my <code>custom.scss</code> file when using Bootstrap with Rails, I'm pretty sure I know **why** I need to include it too, but I don't have the slightest clue as to **how** it works with the <code>asset pipeline</code>.
<br>
<br>
Suddenly, my questions go from, "how do I use <code>has_secure_password</code>", which can mean anything from, "what is the syntax," to "how can I get <code>params</code> from a form", to a clear question which I can solve on my own, or have answered for me in a way that I can remember and repeat again on my own next time. "How does Bootstrap work with Rails", turns into a question whose answer will provide me with higher-level knowledge to help me grow beyond the scope of my immediate issue.
<br>
<br>
When you break down a problem into *what*, *how*, and *why*, you may surprise yourself by having knowledge in at least two out of the three categories. Sometimes, you may even end up with a solution on your own.
<br>
<br>
# When to Ask
<br>
Most developers are very willing to answer questions if they can, but most developers also value their time highly, as they should. So, when is it appropriate to ask for their time to help you? Only after you've exhausted your resources and tried solving the problem yourself. 
<br>
<br>
Walk yourself through each step of the problem, and search through documentation, Stackoverflow, and Google to help fill in the missing gaps. You may not find the answer that you need, but it may just help you clarify your *what*, *how*, and *why*.
<br>
<br>
Being able to ask questions well is an important trait of a great collaborator. No one expects you to have all of the answers, but knowing how to find them, is key.
