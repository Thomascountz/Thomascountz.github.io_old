Today marks a milestone in my studies. No, I haven’t gotten a job yet, and no, I haven’t completed a significant pet project. What I have done, however, is create this site.

I was lucky enough to sit in on a webinar hosted by Erik Trautman, creator of The Odin Project and The Viking School, presenting alongside Viking alumni, Johnny Steenbergen and Sabrina Clark, from Brand Yourself. When I saw the webinar was titled, <a href="https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/getting-hired" target="_blank">How To Get Hired as a Web Developer With a Non-Traditional Background</a>, I’ll be damned if the shoe didn’t fit! 

The essential takeaway from this webinar culminated to this. This website. The presenters had a lot of other things to say, all of which could basically be boiled down into “work harder, build something awesome, share it with the world.” This I already knew and was sometimes struggling to complete. But my single most important take away was to build this website.

I've been studying Ruby and Rails on my own for 25 weeks now with the help of <a href='http://www.theodinproject.com' target='_blank'>The Odin Project</a>. The Odin Project is a free online full-stack bootcamp that focuses on the Ruby on Rails framework. I began studying, like a lot of my collegues, becuase I hope to begin a career in web development, and I don't have the luxury of attending a bootcamp or going back to college to attain a C.S. degree. But that won't stop the industrious! With a resource like The Odin Project, a career change is possible, as lauded by many successful alumn. However, when I jumped into the curriculum, I had no idea the amount of work I was about to be asked to put in.

# A portfolio is only as good as the projects in it, right? Not exactly.
<br>
I'm excited because a portfolio site is a chance for me to tell my story, the story I don’t always get to tell to recruiters or in interviews. Your story is one of your biggest assets when coming from a non-traditional background. It gives you a chance to tell prospective employers that you don’t *expect* a job, you’ve worked hard in between day jobs, after work, in the dark, both day and night; you’ve obsessed over your passion.

So after all of that, where am I? I’m here. A single blog post and not a single item in my projects list. Check back soon!
