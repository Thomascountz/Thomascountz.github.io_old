# "Just one more tutorial..." 
<br>
How many times have we said this to ourselves, and how many times has this stopped us from completing the simplest projects? 

# “I have to look this up <em>again</em>.”
<br>
We feel guilty for having to look up the "simplest" things; the bash command for creating a new file, how to manipulate <code>Datetime</code> objects, or how to incorporate Bootstrap into our project.
<br>
<br>
When we let these thoughts bog us down, we lose sight of our abilities and sell ourselves short until we’re paralyzed from completing anything at all. I've been studying Rails for a while now, and I've finally (almost) completed my first CRUD app. Not because I haven't learned how to do what's required, but simply because I scared myself out of being able to do anything at all!

# Why We Need Failure And Shouldn't Be Afraid 
<br>
In life, in art, in any creative endeavor, we need to fail. If you don't fail, you may not have tried hard enough, and that can limit your potential. I've spent months completing tutorial after tutorial only to amass knowledge without anything to show for it. Imagine the look on recruiters' faces when I told them that, "...sure, I know how to write unit tests for validations, render view partials, and deploy to Heroku, I just haven't done it yet." The reason I haven't done these things yet is simply because I believed that I needed to learn more in order to do them <em>right</em>.
<br>
<br>
# There Is No Right Way
<br>
Most developers won't believe this; especially with an opinionated framework like Rails, where does one get off saying that there isn't a right way? What about the book aptly named, <em>The Rails Way</em>?! It comes down to this: if you wait to learn the "right" way, you'll never finish. Part of The Rails Way includes messing things up before making them right.

# Agile Development <em>is</em> Failing
<br>
A major portion of Agile development is refactoring. Refactoring implies that something needs to be improved, made better, and revived from "wrong" to "right". What this means is that you are not only allowed to get things wrong, you're encouraged to! So go fail and fail hard and you will be lead to success!
