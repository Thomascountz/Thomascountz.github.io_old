# When asked how self-taught developers get started, they often cite attending local Meetups
<br>
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/" target="_blank">Meetup</a> is a website that allows its users to create events, called Meetups, where like minded people can get together, share ideas, build exciting things, and ultimately, walk away with a new network of collaborators. Meetup isn't just for coders, there are Meetups for knitters, cosplayers, weightlifters, and car enthusiasts alike! The first step in getting access to the local Meetup culture and hopefully meeting local devs of all levels, is to create and account and search your locale for a Meetup of your liking.

# Your first Meetup
<br>
If you're like me, heading to your first Meetup can cause a wave of emotions: "Am I good enough?", "Maybe I'll get offered a job!", "What if no one else shows up?", and "Maybe I just shouldn't go!" This is what was happening to me as I was heading to <a href="https://www.meetup.com/hackerhours/" target="_blank">Hacker Hours</a>, a NYC based language agnostic Meetup for new developers, for the first time. I arrived, awkwardly early, I shook hands with the organizer, set up my laptop near an outlet, and pulled up the tutorial I was working on.
<br>
<br>
# "What are you working on?"
<br>
If you're lucky enough to encounter someone who can offer you some help or guidance, this is likely what they'll ask you. It helps to come to a work-based Meetup (as opposed to a non-working talk-based Meetup), with an answer to this question. My first problem came when I answered, <strong>"Oh, I'm just working through this tutorial."</strong> 
<br>
<br>
End of conversation. 
<br>
<br>
An answer like this is useful to neither me nor to the person asking it. If I'm "just working through this tutorial", what can anyone help me with? Instead, it's as if I had said <strong>"Oh, I'm just here to sit in a nice space with big windows and with fast Wifi, but thanks for asking."</strong> Sure, it isn't as harsh as that, but it's still an easy way to dismiss help. What I could have said instead was, <strong>"Oh, I'm working through this project and I'm learning about sockets and HTTP, so I'm building a mock client and server that sends and responds HTTP headers and response bodies."</strong> Followed, perhaps, by a request. <strong>"What do you think the best way to parse a header would be?"</strong> This incites a conversation and an acknowledgement that you're there to receive help. 
<br>
<br>
Tutorials are great, but it's sometimes better if you have your own project and your own problems that you need help with. Oftentimes, a problem you're having with a tutorial can and will be answered by the tutorial itself, if you keep following it. However, a personal project can often leave you in a position where you have lots of questions.
<br>
<br>
# I don't have a project or a problem, should I still go?
<br>
### *YES!* **The biggest mistake made at coding Meetups is not asking what others are working on!**
<br>
<br>
If you don't have a project of your own, that's okay! You can make the difference for others at coding meetups, simply by asking others what it is they're working on. It may be completely out of your ability level, not in the language you're familiar with, or maybe they're not willing to share, but being *honestly* curious about others work, is the best way for you to build connections.
<br>
<br>
I went to a Meetup recently at a firm that builds real estate software. I asked one of the organizers what they were working on, (after they asked me and I gave an ill-prepared response), and I could barely follow what they were talking about. However, I stayed curious and asked what they meant by this or that, and we had a great conversation, from which we both benefited! If you're lucky, you might be able to offer help to someone, or discover similar interests and abilities and form a collaboration for the future.
<br>
<br>
# All in all: stay honest, humble, and open
<br>
The best way to meet fellow coders at Meetups is to take initiative and be curious about what others are doing. Ask questions, be prepared to talk about your project, and even offer help when you can! Lastly, if you don't find a Meetup near you, try making one! Even if you feel like you don't have much to offer, your Meetup just may attract others who can!
