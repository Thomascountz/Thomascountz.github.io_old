<br/> I am a professional actor, baker, and coffee snob now turned self-taught web developer living in NYC. 
<br>
<br> I fell in love with web development not only for its rewarding technical challenges, but for its community. I began studying with a bit of a chip on my shoulder, but already I've been met with such warmth, passion, collaboration, and creativity from my peers and mentors. 
<br>
<br> As I grow, refocus, design, scrap, build, and discover all the brilliance in this field, I take time to pause. I am inspired by knowledge, spurred by an impetus for expression, and channeled by technical precision. I aim to build meaningful experiences through clean elegant code, collaborate with peers and co-creators to express new ideas, and to enrich and maintain products and services that solve problems with dependable solutions. 
<br>
<br> Though I haven’t been a developer for long, I’m on a humble flight.
