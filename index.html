<br/> I am a professional actor, baker, and coffee snob now turned self-taught web developer living in NYC. 
<br>
<br> I fell in love with web development not only for its rewarding technical challenges, but for its community. The developers and collaborators that I've been lucky enough to meet, have provided me with unexpected warmth, passion, and creativity; a wonderful pattern I strive to continue.
<br>
<br> As I grow, refocus, design, scrap, build, and discover all the brilliance in this field, I take time to pause. I am passionate about contributing to open source software, attending Meetups in many disciplines, maintaining a personal/technical blog, and volunteering in community-driven learning.
