<h1>UPDATE</h1> 
<br>
<h1>Checkout the new <a href="https://github.com/Thomascountz/peanuts2/" target="_blank">Peanuts2</a> codebase here.</h1> 
<br>
<p> 
Peanuts has been a very challenging project for me; from simple CRUD app to complex CRUD app was a large leap. So large, in fact, that it's only in hindsight that I see how my awkward and unchecked decision-making has led me to an ill fated and difficult to manage codebase.  
<br> 
<br>
Brilliant! What an amazing new challenge that lies ahead! The coveted "inherited legacy code that must be refractored!" Though valid, my mind takes me to another challenge: scrap and rebuild. So this codebase is out, and the new <a href="https://github.com/Thomascountz/peanuts2/" target="_blank">Peanuts2</a> is in. Check it out!

<h1>What is this?</h1>
<br>
<p>
Peanuts is a Rails app that empowers event managers with an easy interface to manage their ticket sales and attendee lists. Attendees can easily purchase tickets and have eTickets delivered to their email.</p>

<br>
<h1>What problem does it solve?</h1>
<br>

<p>
  Event managers need a way to manage their ticket sales both online and on location. Likewise, attendees need a way to easily purchase tickets.
  <br>
  <br>
  <h4>Goals:</h4>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>To allow event managers to list their event and available tickets</li>
    <li>To allow event managers to maintain a list of attendees and ticket sales</li>
    <li>To allow attendees to purchase a ticket to a particular event</li>
    <li>To allow attendees to maintain a record of their ticket purchases</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<br>
<h1>What's inside?</h1>
<br>
<p>
<strong>tl;dr</strong> Authentication and authorization is handled with devise, testing is done with capybara, RSpec, and factorygirl, styling and javascript is facilitated by Twitter Bootstrap, continuous integration and version control is managed by Semaphore and Git, user stories and issue tracking is delegated by waffle.io/github issues, and deployment is completed by Heroku.

<h1>Where do we go from here?</h1>
<br>

<p>
The aim of the app is to allow artist to charge for their tickets and to fully mimic the functionality of existing solutions, but provide a more minimal interface. I began this project because I'm an artist who was intimidated by the prevailing options, and I hope to quell that intimidation with my easy-to-use app!
</p>

<br>
<h1>What did I learn?</h1>
<br>
<p>
Peanuts is still a work-in-progress, and is my first solo app after getting some experience through open source contributions. The aim of this app is to keep things as clean and well-tested as possible to allow other contributors to feel excited about picking issues to tackle. This app is slow going, but I strive to feel proud of every commit.
