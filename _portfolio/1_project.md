<h1>What is this?</h1>
<br>
<p>
Clerk is a work-in-progress rails 5 app.
</p>

<br>
<h1>What problem does it solve?</h1>
<br>

<p>
Splitting bills is something my roommies and I have to do every month. We use a spreadsheet that we copypaste into an email. How barbaric! This app exists to provide us (and you!) with some UI features that other split-payment apps don't have. And with Clerk, we can keep track of the apartment expenses besides just the bills, i.e. the $88 worth of toilet paper I bought last week... #UOMe.

<br>
<h1>What's inside?</h1>
<br>
<p>
Rails 5, Postgresql 9.6, TDD with RSpec & Capybara.
<br>
<p>

</p>

<br>
<h1>What's else?</h1>
<br>

<p>
After suffering through excel spreadsheets with my roommates, I decided to tackle this problem with a Rails app. My focus from the beginning has been on developing a workflow that embodies the principals that I respect most in other developers. So, I begun with wireframing and user stories to help hone in on exactly how I wished to tackle this problem. How have other developers solved this problem? What did I like about their solution? What didn't I like? What features would I prioritize for an MVP? As the client, developer, and designer, how can I effectively communicate with myself when I'm wearing so many hats?

</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Clerk MVP userflow wireframe 
</div>
<br>
With cards in hand, moving on to TDD was an intuitive next step, and one that I praise highly. I love testing, I have an honest obsession, and by putting in extra effort towards planning and managing, I've found myself in a comfortable flow.
</p>

<br>
<h1>What's next?</h1>
<br>

<p>
The next steps are to get the MVP into the hands of users, (namely my roommates and I), as quickly as possible. That feedback will drive the next iteration, and finally I won't be the only one wearing a hat on this project.
