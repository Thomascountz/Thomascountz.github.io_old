<h1>What is this?</h1>
<br>
<p>
Chalk is a work-in-progress social media app for climbers to log their climbs, track their progress, and interact with other climbers.

<br>
<h1>What problem does it solve?</h1>
<br>

<p>
Chalk allows its users to measure and record their abilities as a way to gain insight into their growth and formulate plans for progress. The social-side of the app allows users to connect with other climbers and challenge friends to top similar routes.
